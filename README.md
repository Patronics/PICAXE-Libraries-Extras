# PICAXE Libraries and Extras
Extra code and libraries I have written for PICAXE microcontrollers.

Feedback / Improvements are welcome.

## Python Preprocessor
Implementation of a very simple and limited preprocessor for the PICAXE compiler.
Click [here](PythonPreprocessor/README.md) for more info.

## Musescore Tune Converter
A small Musescore 3 plugin to convert simple tunes into code that can be used by the PICAXE tune command.
