# PICAXE Libraries and Extras
Extra code and libraries I have written for PICAXE microcontrollers or making life easier when dealing with them.

Feedback / Improvements are welcome.

## LoRa and PJON drivers for SX127* based LoRa modules
Some code and modules for interfacing a PICAXE microcontroller to an SX127* based radio module. This code allows sending and receiving of raw LoRa packets and or encoding and decoding them using a limited implementation of the PJON protocol.

Click [here](LoRa%20and%20PJON/README.md) for more info.

## Python Preprocessor
Implementation of a very simple and limited preprocessor for the PICAXE compiler.

Click [here](PythonPreprocessor/README.md) for more info.
[This preprocessor](https://github.com/Patronics/PicaxePreprocess) is very similar and has more features implemented, so I recommend that you use that one if you can.

## Musescore Tune Converter
A small Musescore 3 plugin to convert simple tunes into code that can be used by the PICAXE tune command.
