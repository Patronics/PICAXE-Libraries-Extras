# PICAXE Libraries and Extras
Extra code and libraries I have written for PICAXE microcontrollers or making life easier when dealing with them.

Feedback / Improvements are welcome.

## Python Preprocessor
Implementation of a very simple and limited preprocessor for the PICAXE compiler.
Click [here](PythonPreprocessor/README.md) for more info.
[This preprocessor](https://github.com/Patronics/PicaxePreprocess) is very similar and has more features implemented, so I recommend that you use that one if you can.

## Musescore Tune Converter
A small Musescore 3 plugin to convert simple tunes into code that can be used by the PICAXE tune command.
